This application is deployed to GitHub Pages. The instructions in [Create React App Docs on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) show how to create a build that you can deploy.
This app was created from scratch using the command
`npx create-react-app dev-portfolio`
Then this app was added to GitHub with these commands
`git remote add origin git@github.com:minprocess/dev-portfolio.git`
`git branch -M main`
